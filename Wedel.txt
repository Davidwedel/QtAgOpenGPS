My own notes.

Need to finish the tractor steer config page sometime

min gps step
dual
reverse det
remove icon on those 3 but use iconbuttoncolor if possible

add sliders to steer config page(dependant upon the buttons above them)


And need to catch up the UI to Brian's latest.

And add AgIO

Really need to figure out how to change icons to grayscale, when they aren't needed/wanted
That is done in the Colorize section of the button file.


Need to set steerconfigwindow/line editor to their own windows, so we can move them around on the screen, instead of being anchored to one spot

Field picker for drive in field is basically the field open menu, except it is populated with the closest 4 fields unless you're in one. with one or two buttons hidden.
