My plan-- At this point, I intend to create a GUI that follows AOG. 
When that is done, catch up the backend with AOG, and make AgIO.
If you are interested in helping, feel very free to.

Need to finish the tractor steer config page sometime. I apparently forgot about it. (Would help if Brian didn't keep changing the GUI:)

My own Notes:

min gps step
dual
reverse det
remove icon on those 3 but use iconbuttoncolor if possible

set work switch section control buttons correctly

uturn style move over
hyd enable
invert relays set margin
trams
