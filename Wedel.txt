My own notes.

Really should wrap the main window area in a mouseclicked area, to stop phantom clicks from carrying through from the config pages.

Need to finish the tractor steer config page sometime

min gps step
dual
reverse det
remove icon on those 3 but use iconbuttoncolor if possible

set work switch section control buttons correctly

add sliders to steer config page(dependant upon the buttons above them)

need to rework the vehicle/field/line picker.
right now they're coded to /home/[my user]/Documents/QtAgOpenGPS/etc., so they will only work on my computer.
using ~/Documents/QtAgOpenGPS/etc does not work

Need to change the AB Line/curve(later) editors. 
Right now they are linked to the AB Line button.
So you turn off the AB Line when you open the window to pick which line you want. 
They need to open if the AB Line is active, and the line button is clicked

And need to catch up the UI to Brian's latest.

And add AgIO

Really need to figure out how to change icons to grayscale, when they aren't needed/wanted
That is done in the Colorize section of the button file.
