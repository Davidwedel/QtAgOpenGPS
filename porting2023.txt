Todo: move distancePivotToTurnLine from main form to cvehicle.  only CYouTurn refers to it in classes

TODO
- move distancePivotToTurnLine from main form to CVehicle
- move CDubinsTurningRadius form CYouTurn to CDubins
- move isOutOfBounds from main form to CVehicle, stop using signal from CYouTurn
- move guidanceLookPos from main form to CVehicle
- move isReverse from main form to CVehicle
- move guidanceLineDistanceOff, guidanceLineSteeringAngle to CVehicle



Notes
- CYouTube::youTurnStartOffset not needed; addSequenceLines pulls it directly from settings
- In CYouTube constructor, originally populated variables from settings. Now
  we pull from settings inside each method that needs it.
